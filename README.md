# ⚔️ WHArmy Builder 🔧

**Your digital Forge World for crafting the ultimate Warhammer armies!**

---

Welcome, noble hobbyist and digital tech-priest! This is the **WHArmy Builder**, a desktop application designed to help you forge, customize, and deploy your Warhammer 40K armies with ease and efficiency.

Inspired by the might of the Adeptus Mechanicus and coded with the diligence of a Skitarii scribe, this tool allows commanders to create their own units, assign stats, and build fearsome legions in preparation for the tabletop battlefield.

## 🔥 Features

- 🛡 **Unit Creation**: Forge new unit profiles from the void! Add a name, faction, stats (movement, wounds, save, bravery, etc.), and let your creativity flow.
- 📦 **JSON Import/Export**: Save your armies as `.json` files and reload them with the ease of a seasoned tech-priest communing with the Machine Spirit.
- (work in progress) 🖥 **Modern UI**: A simple and efficient Qt-based GUI interface to keep your focus on the battle, not the bureaucracy.
- (work in progress) 🛠 **Cross-Platform Ready**: Whether you're a Linux Battle-Brother, a Windows Guardsman, or a macOS Eldar, WHArmy Builder is with you!
